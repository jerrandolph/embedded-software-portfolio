# Embedded Software Portfolio by Jeremy Randolph

## Introduction
My goal is transition from Distributed Systems Engineering to Embedded Software Engineering. To this end, I've been engaging in indepentent study to learn about microcontroller programming, real-time contol systems, and electronics circuits and design. This repo contains a summary of the work I've done and the current state of the projects.

## Projects

### Inverted Pendulum V1
The first version of this project uses a MSP-430 to control a reaction wheel. Telemtry data is exported over UART and saved to a time series DB.

### Inverted Pendulum V2
The second version of this project uses a Nucleo-64 to contol a servo motor. Telemetry data is exported over UART and displayed in real time.
